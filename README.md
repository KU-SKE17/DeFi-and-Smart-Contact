## week1 Time and Money

`Current Value better than Future Value`

Because:

1. Opportunity Cost
   - better economic growth
   - (loose the opportunity to invest)
2. Inflation
   - gov prints more money
   - (time goes by, money later worth less)
3. Risk
   - wars, disasters, etc.
   - (I may not be here to use the money)

### Compounding

- Effective -> ‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏¢‡∏ó‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏õ‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πÜ
- Calculate -> `Future Value`

#### Future Value

    FV = PV(1+r)^t

- FV = Future Value
- PV = Current Value
- r = Interest Rate
- t = deration (years)

#### Effective vs Nominal Rates

    Reff = (1+(Rnom/n))^n

- Nominal = periodic rate times the number of periods
- Effective = nominal rate + compounded rate
- ex.
  - Nominal rate
  - 6% per year = (6%/12) = 0.5% per month
  - Effective rate
  - (1+0.5%)^12 = 6.17% per year

`Effective Rates > Nominal Rates`

#### Present Value

    PV = FV/(1+r)^t

$100 in next 50 years is nothing. if discounted(r) = 10%

### Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)

- method of valuing an investment
- discounts all cash flows back to present value
- investors buy different assets to earn a return and use the money later
- investment value -> (When/How much) cash is coming in?

#### Simple Bond

- Bond Worth = total worth of payment each year
- payment each year = payment - discounts rate
- ex.
  - simple bond of 3,000 with annual payment of 250 for 5 years, discount rate 7%
  - bond worth (Present Value) = 3,164 (233.6 + 218.4 + 204.1 + 190.7 + 2,317.2)

#### Stock Valuation

- stock analysts
- ex. ‡∏ñ‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏∞‡∏ñ‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏´‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏ß‡πâ 5 ‡∏õ‡∏µ ‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ú‡∏•‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡πâ‡∏°‡πÑ‡∏°

#### Other Assets

- Real Estate
- Mergers and Acquisitions
- Derivatives

### Valuation by Comparables

- Practitioners often refer to `comps`
- Comparable transactions or prices
- Quick, easy, and dangerous! -> what is your assumptions?

#### Assumptions for Comps

1. You can identify close comparables
2. You have a value‚Äìrelevant ratio
3. The market values comps similarly

```txt
Asset Price = (Price/Attribute) * Attribute
```

- Asset Price = price of your asset
- Attribute = your attribute
  - `P/E ratios`
  - Earnings Yield
  - Dividend Yield
  - Return on Assets
  - EBITDA multiples
  - etc.

`P/E ratios` (Price‚Äìto‚Äìearnings ratio)

- popular
- use to compare 2 cost/deal btw 2 places
- ex. Home Depot vs Lowes

#### Other Comps

- Return on Assets or Equity (ROA/ROE)
- Return on invested capital (ROI)
- Dividend yield
- PEG ratio (P/E ratio over Growth in E)

### Comps VS DCF

- Both can provide useful information
- Executed correctly, both are valid
- Comps often used (and abused) in practice
- Both require forecasts
- DCF is more appealing in theory and more accurate, but requires much more work
- Comps can be a good quick-and-dirty valuation, but be
  careful!

## week2 Capital Budgeting

`Foundation`: cost vs benefit analysis

Best Practices

- Arms-length
- Objective
- Transparent

Decisions Obtained

- Accept or reject
- Best of all the candidate projects
- Ranking of different projects

### Net Present Value (NPV)

- Best capital budgeting tool & Best Practices
- Add up the PV of all future cash
- Compare with initial investment

`Decision rule`: Invest if NPV > 0

    NPV = i + ùù®t (cash_flow_of(t)/(1+r)^t)

- i = initial_investment
- t = 1 to end of project
- r = discount rate

#### Main Drivers of NPV

- Cash flow (the more the better)
- Timing (the sooner the better)
- Discount rate (the lower the better)

### Payback Period

- How long it takes to earn back initial investment

`Decision rule`: invest if payback less than a specified time (e.g., 1 year, 10 years, etc)

Pros:

- Time is money - reflecting the opportunity cost

Cons:

- Neglects cash after the payback
- Neglects timing for future cash flow
- Neglects risk - no discount rate consideration
- Arbitrary cut off - Non objective, not arms-length

### Accounting Ratio

- Measure the ratio of A/B

`Decision rule`: invest if the ratio > (some threshold)

Pros:

- More money is better
- Reflects the use of capital

Cons:

- Neglects timing
- Includes accounting distortions (e.g., depreciation or some non-cash expenses)
- Neglects risk
- Arbitrary cut off

#### Return on invested capital (ROIC)

    ROIC = NOPAT/IC

- NOPAT = Net Profit after Tax
- IC = invested capital

#### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

- What discount rate makes NPV = 0?
  - Discounting more drives NPV down
- How hard can NPV get hit and stay > 0
- This decision rule is similar to NPV
  - Scales NPV into a %
  - More intuitive
- Accounts for timing, opportunity cost, and risk

`Decision rule`: invest if that IRR rate > current discount rate

    NPV = (ùù®t (cash_flow_of(t)/(1+IRR)^t)) - i = 0

- i = initial_investment
- t = 1 to end of project
