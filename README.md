## week1 Time and Money

`Current Value better than Future Value`

Because:

1. Opportunity Cost
   - better economic growth
   - (loose the opportunity to invest)
2. Inflation
   - gov prints more money
   - (time goes by, money later worth less)
3. Risk
   - wars, disasters, etc.
   - (I may not be here to use the money)

### Compounding

- Effective -> ได้ดอกเบี้ยทบกันไปเลื่อยๆ
- Calculate -> `Future Value`

### Future Value

    FV = PV(1+r)^t

- FV = Future Value
- PV = Current Value
- r = Interest Rate
- t = deration (years)

### Effective vs Nominal Rates

    Reff = (1+(Rnom/n))^n

`Effective Rates > Nominal Rates`
